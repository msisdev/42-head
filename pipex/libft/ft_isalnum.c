	checks  for  an alphanumeric character; it is equivalent to (isalpha(c)

The standards require that the argument c for these functions is
	either EOF or a value that is representable in the type unsigned char.

If the argument c is of type char, it must be cast to
	unsigned char, as in the following example:

		char c;
		...
		res = toupper((unsigned char) c);

This is necessary because char may be the equivalent of
	signed char, in which case a byte where the top bit
	is set would be sign extended when converting to int,
	yielding a value that is outside the range of unsigned char.
